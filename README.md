# ðŸ”Š Podcast scraping pipeline ðŸ”Š

Personal project I am working on to create a corpus of interactions in spoken French for syntactic and prosodic investigations.

The creation of this pipeline will be followed by the:

- creation of a speech-to-text application for the transcription of the spoken interactions collected from podcasts, and aligns them to the audio to permit prosodic investigations;

- creation of the corpus and the interface to access it.

The project will open access from A to Z.
