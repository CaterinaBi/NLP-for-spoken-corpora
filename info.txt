This constitutes the first step of the establishment of a corpus of spoken French.
NECESSARY: Obtain additional funds.

Forecasted trajectory:

1- Choose websites to scrape podcasts from (YouTube out)

2- Download files and save them scalably on the clud

3- Utilise speech-to-text API to transcribe videos

4- Start working on data

(Tagging of corpus will be done by assistants when funds are obtained)

Possible choice of website to be determined. At the time being, [radio-en-ligne.fr/podcasts](https://www.radio-en-ligne.fr/podcasts) seems the best option.

Possible choices for API: Speechmatics, Microsoft
